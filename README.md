# config
Configs for xmonad/qtile, zsh, xmobar and more

Remember you need to have the following installed for either xmonad or qtile to work,
- zsh (and powerline)
- terminator
- compton (For terminal transparency)

For xmonad you need to have following installed,
- xmonad
- xmobar

And for qtile the following,
- qtile

And for your own sake, autojump

The get-volume.sh script is used to display volume in xmobar, look in xmonad.hs to change or check the path.
To get the spotify display in xmobar to work a script is needed, I have used this, https://github.com/getmicah/spotify-now
